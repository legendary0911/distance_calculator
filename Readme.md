# Distance calculator using GOOGLE map API

I was going to start my intern and was looking for PGs near my office. I got a long list of PGs which had more than 170 entries and calculating the distance of each pg from my office was a very hefty task. So I made python program that will calculate the distance of your office from each PG in the excel sheet using GOOGLE MAP API and add make a new excel sheet with distance as an additional field and sort it according to the distance in ascending order.

## How to Start

- Install all the dependencies as mentioned in requirements.txt
- Sign up for Google Maps API key
- Create a new project
- Activate Google Map Distance Matrix API
- Add your api key to .env file
- Add your office address in main.py
- Run main.py and you are good to go
